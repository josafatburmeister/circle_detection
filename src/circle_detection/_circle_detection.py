    Detects circles in a set of 2D points using the M-estimator method proposed in `Garlipp, Tim, and Christine
    H. Müller. "Detection of Linear and Circular Shapes in Image Analysis." Computational Statistics & Data Analysis
    51.3 (2006): 1479-1490. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2006.04.022>`__

    The input of the method a set of 2D points :math:`\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_N, y_N)\}`. Circles with different center
    positions and radii are generated as starting values for the circle detection process. The parameters of these
    initial circles are then optimized iteratively to align them with the input points.

    Given a circle with the center :math:`(a, b)` and a radius :math:`r`, the circle parameters are optimized
    by minimizing the following loss function (note that in the work by Garlipp and Müller, the function is formulated
    as a score function to be maximized and therefore has a positive instead of a negative sign):

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            L(\begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{s} \rho
            \Biggl(
                \frac{\|\begin{bmatrix}x_i, y_i \end{bmatrix}^T - \begin{bmatrix} a, b \end{bmatrix}^T\| - r}{s}
            \Biggr)
        \end{eqnarray}

    Here, :math:`\rho` is a kernel function and :math:`s` is the kernel bandwidth. In this implementation, the standard
    Gaussian distribution with :math:`\mu = 0` and :math:`\sigma = 1` is used as the kernel function:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            \rho(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}
        \end{eqnarray}

    To minimize the loss function :math:`L`,
    `Newton's method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization>`__ is used. In each
    optimization step, this method updates the parameters as follows:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            \begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}_{t+1} = \begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}_t - s \cdot
            \nabla L([a, b, r]) \cdot \biggl[\nabla^2 L([a, b, r])\biggr]^{-1}
        \end{eqnarray}

    Here, :math:`s` is the step size. Since the Newton step requires to compute the inverse of the Hessian
    matrix of the loss function :math:`\bigl[\nabla^2 L([a, b, r])\bigr]^{-1}`, it can not be applied if the
    Hessian matrix is not invertible. Additionally, the Newton step only moves towards a local minimum if the
    determinant of the Hessian matrix is positive. Therefore, a simple gradient descent update step is used instead of
    the Newton step if the determinant of the Hessian matrix is not positive:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            \begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}_{t+1} = \begin{bmatrix} a, b, r \end{bmatrix}_t - s \cdot
            \nabla L([a, b, r])
        \end{eqnarray}

    To determine a suitable step size :math:`s` for each step that results in a sufficient decrease of the loss
    function, the following rules are used:

    1. The initial step size :math:`s_0` is set to 1.
    2. If gradient descent is used in the optimization step, the step size is repeatedly increased by multiplying it
       with an acceleration factor :math:`\alpha > 1`, as long as increasing the step size results in a greater decrease
       of the loss function for the step. More formally, the step size update :math:`s_{k+1} = \alpha \cdot s_k` is
       repeated as long as the following condition is fullfilled:

       .. math::
           :nowrap:

           \begin{eqnarray}
           L(c + s_{k+1} \cdot d) < L(c + s_k \cdot d),
           \end{eqnarray}

       Here, :math:`d` is the step direction, :math:`c = [a, b, r]_{t}` are the circle's current parameters, and
       :math:`k` is the number of acceleration steps. No acceleration is applied for steps using Newton's method,
       as the Newton method itself includes an adjustment of the step size.

    3. If the gradient descent step size is not increased in (2) or Newton's method is used,
       the initial step size may be still too large to produce a sufficient decrease of the loss function. In this case,
       the initial step size is decreased until the step results in a sufficient decrease of the loss function. For this
       purpose, a `backtracking line-search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_line_search>`__ according to
       `Armijo's rule <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxh2kqVz6lk>`__ is performed. Armijo's rule has two
       hyperparameters :math:`\beta \in (0, 1)` and :math:`\gamma \in (0,1)`. The step size is repeatedly decreased by
       multiplying it with the attenuation factor :math:`\beta` until the decrease of the loss function is at least a
       fraction :math:`\gamma` of the loss decrease expected based on a linear approximation of the loss function by its
       first-order Taylor polynomial. More formally, Armijo's rule repeats the step size update
       :math:`s_{k+1} = \beta \cdot s_k` until the following condition is fullfilled:

       .. math::
            :nowrap:

            \begin{eqnarray}
            L(c) - L(c + s_k \cdot d) \geq - \gamma \cdot s_k \cdot \nabla L(c) d^T
            \end{eqnarray}


    To be able to identify circles at different positions and of different sizes, the optimization is repeated with
    different starting values for the initial circle parameters. The starting values for the center coordinates
    :math:`(a, b)` are generated by placing points on a regular grid. The limits of the grid in x- and y-direction
    are defined by the parameters :code:`min_start_x`, :code:`max_start_x`, :code:`min_start_y`, and
    :code:`max_start_y`. The number of grid points is defined by the parametrs :code:`n_start_x` and :code:`n_start_y`.
    For each start position, :code:`n_start_radius` different starting values for the circle radius :math:`r` are
    tested, evenly covering the interval defined by :code:`min_start_radius` and :code:`max_start_radius`.

    To filter out circles for which the optimization does not converge, allowed value ranges are defined for the circle
    parameters by :code:`break_min_x`, :code:`break_max_x`, :code:`break_min_y`, :code:`break_max_y`,
    :code:`break_min_radius`, and :code:`break_max_radius`. If the parameters of a circle leave these value ranges
    during optimization, the optimization of the respective circle is terminated and the circle is discarded.

    Circles that were initialized with different start values can converge to the same local optimum, which can lead to
    duplicates among the detected circles. Such duplicates can be filtered by setting the :code:`precision` parameter.
    In this way, the parameters of all detected circles are rounded with the specified precision and if the parameters
    of several circles are equal after rounding, only one of them is kept.

    Since the loss function can have several local minima, it is possible that the circle detection produces several
    overlapping circles. If it is expected that circles do not overlap, non-maximum suppression can be applied. With
    non-maximum suppression, circles that overlap with other circles, are only kept if they have the lowest fitting loss
    among the circles with which they overlap.

        xy: Coordinates of the set of 2D points in which to detect circles.
        bandwidth: Kernel bandwidth.
        batch_lengths: Number of points in each point set of the input batch. For batch processing, it is
            expected that all points belonging to the same point set are stored consecutively in the :code:`xy` input
            array. For example, if the input is a batch of two point sets (i.e., two batch items) with :math:`N_1`
            points and :math:`N_2` points, then :code:`batch_lengths` should be set to :code:`[N_1, N_2]` and
            :code:`xy[:N_1]` should contain the points of the first point set and :code:`circles[N_1:]` the points of
            the second point set. If :code:`batch_lengths` is set to :code:`None`, it is assumed that the input points
            all belong to the same point set and batch processing is disabled. Defaults to :code:`None`.

        non_maximum_suppression: Whether non-maximum suppression should be applied to the detected circles. If this
            option is enabled, circles that overlap with other circles, are only kept if they have the lowest fitting
            loss among the circles with which they overlap. Defaults to :code:`True`.

        order: x-coordinate of the center, y-coordinate of the center, radius). The second array contains the fitting
        losses of the detected circles (lower means better). The third array contains the number of circles detected for
        each batch item (circles belonging to the same batch item are stored consecutively in the output array).
