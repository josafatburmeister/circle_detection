    r"""
    Non-maximum suppression operation to remove overlapping circles. If a circle overlaps with other circles, it is
    only kept if it has the highest fitting score among the circles with which it overlaps. This method supports batch
    processing, i.e. separate sets of circles (i.e., different batch items) can be processed in parallel. For this
    purpose, :code:`batch_lengths` must be set to specify which circle belongs to which set.

    Args:
        circles: Parameters of the circles to which apply non-maximum suppression (in the following order:
            x-coordinate of the center, y-coordinate of the center, radius). If the :code:`circles` array has a
            row-major storage layout (`numpy's <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/internals.html>`__ default), a copy of
            the array is created. To pass :code:`circles` by reference, :code:`circles` must be in column-major format.
        fitting_scores: Fitting scores of the circles to which apply non-maximum suppression (higher means better).
        batch_lengths: Number of circles in each item of the input batch. For batch processing, it is expected that
            all circles and fitting scores belonging to the same batch item are stored consecutively in the respective
            input array. For example, if a batch comprises two batch items with :math:`N_1` circles and :math:`N_2`
            circles, then :code:`batch_lengths` should be set to :code:`[N_1, N_2]` and :code:`circles[:N_1]` should
            contain the circles of the first batch item and :code:`circles[N_1:]` the circles of the second batch item.
            If :code:`batch_lengths` is set to :code:`None`, it is assumed that the input circles belong to a single
            batch item and batch processing is disabled.
        num_workers: Number of workers threads to use for parallel processing. If set to -1, all CPU threads are used.

    Returns:
        : Tuple of four arrays. The first contains the parameters of the circles remaining after non-maximum
        suppression and the second the corresponding fitting scores. The third contains the number of circles in each
        item of the output batch. The fourth contains the indices of the selected circles in the input array.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If :code:`circles` and :code:`fitting_scores` have different lengths or if :code:`batch_lengths` is
            not :code:`None` and the length of :code:`circles` is not equal to the sum of :code:`batch_lengths`.

    Shape:
        - :code:`circles`: :math:`(C, 3)`
        - :code:`fitting_scores`: :math:`(C)`
        - :code:`batch_lengths`: :math:`(B)`
        - Output: The first array in the output tuple has shape :math:`(C', 3)`, the second shape :math:`(C')`, the
          third shape :math:`(B)`, and the fourth has shape :math:`(C')`.
