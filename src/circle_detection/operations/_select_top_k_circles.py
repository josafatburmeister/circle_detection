    r"""
    Selects the :code:`k` circles with the highest fitting scores from a set of circles. If the set of circles contains
    less than :code:`k` circles, all circles are kept. This method supports batch processing, i.e. separate sets of
    circles (i.e., different batch items) can be filtered in parallel. For this purpose, :code:`batch_lengths` must be
    set to specify which circle belongs to which set.

    Args:
        circles: Parameters of the circles to filter (in the following order: x-coordinate of the center, y-coordinate
            of the center, radius).
        fitting_scores: Fitting scores of the circles to filter (higher means better).
        k: Number of circles to select from each set of circles.
        batch_lengths: Number of circles in each item of the input batch. For batch processing, it is expected that
            all circles and fitting scores belonging to the same batch item are stored consecutively in the respective
            input array. For example, if a batch comprises two batch items with :math:`N_1` circles and :math:`N_2`
            circles, then :code:`batch_lengths` should be set to :code:`[N_1, N_2]` and :code:`circles[:N_1]` should
            contain the circles of the first batch item and :code:`circles[N_1:]` the circles of the second batch item.
            If :code:`batch_lengths` is set to :code:`None`, it is assumed that the input circles belong to a single
            batch item and batch processing is disabled. Defaults to :code:`None`.

    Returns:
        : Tuple of four arrays: The first contains the parameters of the selected circles and the second the
        corresponding fitting scores. The third contains the number of circles in each item of the output batch. The
        fourth contains the indices of the selected circles in the input array.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If :code:`circles` and :code:`fitting_scores` have different lengths or if :code:`batch_lengths` is
            not :code:`None` and the length of :code:`circles` is not equal to the sum of :code:`batch_lengths`.

    Shape:
        - :code:`circles`: :math:`(C, 3)`
        - :code:`fitting_scores`: :math:`(C)`
        - :code:`batch_lengths`: :math:`(B)`
        - Output: The first array in the output tuple has shape :math:`(C', 3)`, the second shape :math:`(C')`, the
          third shape :math:`(B)`, and the fourth shape :math:`(C')`.
