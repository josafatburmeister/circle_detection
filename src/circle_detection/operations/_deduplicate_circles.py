    Deduplicates circles whose parameters do not differ up to the decimal place specified by
    :code:`deduplication_precision`. This method supports batch processing, i.e. separate sets of
    circles (i.e., different batch items) can be processed in parallel. For this purpose, :code:`batch_lengths` must be
    set to specify which circle belongs to which set.

    Args:
        circles: Parameters of the circles to deduplicate (in the following order: x-coordinate of the center,
            y-coordinate of the center, radius).
        deduplication_precision: Number of decimal places taken into account for deduplication.
        batch_lengths: Number of circles in each item of the input batch. For batch processing, it is expected that
            all circles belonging to the same batch item are stored consecutively in the respective
            input array. For example, if a batch comprises two batch items with :math:`N_1` circles and :math:`N_2`
            circles, then :code:`batch_lengths` should be set to :code:`[N_1, N_2]` and :code:`circles[:N_1]` should
            contain the circles of the first batch item and :code:`circles[N_1:]` the circles of the second batch item.
            If :code:`batch_lengths` is set to :code:`None`, it is assumed that the input circles belong to a single
            batch item and batch processing is disabled. Defaults to :code:`None`.

    Returns:
        : Tuple of three arrays: The first contains the parameters of the circles remaining after deduplication. The
        second contains the number of circles in each item of the output batch. The third contains the indices of the
        selected circles in the input array.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If :code:`deduplication_precision` is not a positive number or :code:`batch_lengths` is not
            :code:`None` and the length of :code:`circles` is not equal to the sum of :code:`batch_lengths`.

    Shape:
        - :code:`circles`: :math:`(C, 3)`
        - :code:`batch_lengths`: :math:`(B)`
        - Output: The first array in the output tuple has shape :math:`(C', 3)`, the second shape :math:`(B)`, and the
          third shape :math:`(C')`.

        |
