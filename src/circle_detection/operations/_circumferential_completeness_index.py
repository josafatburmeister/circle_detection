    r"""
    Calculates the circumferential completeness indices of the specified circles. The circumferential completeness index
    is a metric that measures how well a circle fitted to a set of points is covered by points. It was proposed in
    `Krisanski, Sean, Mohammad Sadegh Taskhiri, and Paul Turner. "Enhancing Methods for Under-canopy Unmanned Aircraft \
    System Based Photogrammetry in Complex Forests for Tree Diameter Measurement." Remote Sensing 12.10 (2020): 1652. \
    <https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12101652>`__ To calculate the circumference completeness index of a circle, the circle is
    divided into :code:`num_regions` angular regions. An angular region is considered complete if it contains at least
    one point whose distance to the circle outline is equal to or less than :code:`max_dist`. The circumferential
    completeness index is then defined as the proportion of angular regions that are complete. This method supports
    batch processing, i.e., separate sets of circles (i.e., different batch items) can be processed in parallel. For
    this purpose, :code:`batch_lengths_circles` and :code:`batch_lengths_xy` must be set to specify which circle / which
    point belongs to which set.

    Args:
        circles: Parameters of the circles for which to compute the circumferential completeness indices. Each circle
            must be defined by three parameters in the following order: x-coordinate of the center, y-coordinate of the
            center, radius. If the :code:`circles` array has a row-major storage layout
            (`numpy's <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/internals.html>`__ default) a copy of the array is created. To
            pass :code:`circles` by reference, :code:`circles` must be in column-major format.
        xy: Coordinates of the set of 2D points to which the circles were fitted. If the :code:`xy` array has a
            row-major storage layout (`numpy's <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/internals.html>`__ default) a copy of
            the array is created. To pass :code:`xy` by reference, :code:`xy` must be in column-major format.
        num_regions: Number of angular regions.
        max_dist: Maximum distance a point can have to the circle outline to be counted as part of the circle. If set to
            :code:`None`, points are counted as part of the circle if their distance to the circle is center is in the
            interval :math:`[0.7 \cdot r, 1.3 \cdot r]` where :math:`r` is the circle radius. Defaults to :code:`None`.
        batch_lengths_circles: Number of circles in each item of the input batch. For batch processing, it is
            expected that all circles belonging to the same batch item are stored consecutively in the :code:`circles`
            input array. For example, if a batch comprises two batch items with :math:`N_1` circles and :math:`N_2`
            circles, then :code:`batch_lengths_circles` should be set to :code:`[N_1, N_2]` and :code:`circles[:N_1]`
            should contain the circles of the first batch item and :code:`circles[N_1:]` the circles of the second batch
            item. If :code:`batch_lengths_circles` is set to :code:`None`, it is assumed that the input circles
            belong to a single batch item and batch processing is disabled. Defaults to :code:`None`.
        batch_lengths_xy: Number of points in each item of the input batch. For batch processing, it is
            expected that all points belonging to the same batch item are stored consecutively in the :code:`xy`
            input array. If :code:`batch_lengths_xy` is set to :code:`None`, it is assumed that the input points
            belong to a single batch item and batch processing is disabled. Defaults to :code:`None`.
        num_workers: Number of workers threads to use for parallel processing. If set to -1, all CPU threads are used.
            Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        Circumferential completeness indices of the circles.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the length of :code:`circles` is not equal to the sum of :code:`batch_lengths_circles`, if
            the length of :code:`xy` is not equal to the sum of :code:`batch_lengths_xy`, if
            :code:`batch_lengths_circles` is :code:`None` and :code:`batch_lengths_xy` not (or vice versa), or if
